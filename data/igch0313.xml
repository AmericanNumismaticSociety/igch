    Information from M. Oeconomides
    Three Thessalian League coins acquired by 
        Athens in 1952 (BCH 1953, p. 194) are 
        probably from this find. Another lot 
        of 33 double-vict. now in the possession 
        of O. Dodson (varieties on record in 
        ANS) would seem to derive from the 
        same hd. It was purchased in 1955 
        and said to have come from Kozani 
        but this is highly unlikely as Thessalian 
        material rarely turns up in Macedonian 
        hds.
