    Orsi speaks of the hd. as divided among 
        "persone di Vizzini e Mineo," and Noe 
        1164, also containing copies of Thasian 
        tetradr., is surely another account of 
        the Buccheri hd. Despite the similarity 
        of date and location there seems no 
        connection with the only hd. recorded 
        from Mineo (no. 2184 below)
    Chronologically the presence of issues of 
        Thasos is difficult to explain, for even 
        though their date is earlier than used 
        to be supposed, it can hardly be earlier 
        than c. 180 B.C. (cf. ANSMN 12 
        (1966), p. 61 and note 4), whereas the 
        rest of the hd. suggests c. 300 B.C. or 
        even earlier. Since Orsi was able to 
        record fragments of the hd. only after 
        dispersal, it is possible that the Thasos 
        coins do not really belong here
